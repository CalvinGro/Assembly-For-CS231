Radix Sort Analysis

    This assembly radix sort used 2n space by making use of C's malloc function
to allocate the needed heap memory for the user specified size of the array. It
used only two arrays of the given size: the initial array and a bin array. 
    It works correctly and efficiency, I wrote a function that loops through the
array comparing each number to the one that appeared before it, and check if it
was larger. I then print the findings of that function.
