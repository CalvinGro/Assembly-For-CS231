Description -   This is a library of the macros I use throughout this
              program. I have two print macros, one that takes one argument
              and another that takes 2. The first args will be addresses to
              strings and the second arg for print2 is a integer to print.
              I also have a macro for C's scanf and one to generate random
              numbers. 
                The macro to generate random numbers does not take any args
              and presumes a seed has already been set by srand. It uses 
              C's rand function to generate a number and then divides it by
              50,000 which stores the remainder in %dx.
